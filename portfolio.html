<h1>Jen's online portfolio</h1>
<p>My name is Jen.  I was born in August and studied at Western University.  I have worked on many exciting projects, the most recent of which is a dynamic and growing Pet Adoption website.

For now, I am stuck with Netflix.<br><br>I speak

</ul>
I have taken the following courses:<ol>
<li>Web Foundations</li>
